  Introduction & Credits
--------------------------

CAPtoIJC is a simple command line tool that calls the GlobalPlatform library's
"CAP to IJC" file conversion function.  This is helpful when you need an IJC file, 
say, for the Red Hat Certificate System, and your compliation process yields only 
a CAP file (e.g. Java Card SDK).

This project's CMake scripts and accompanying readme/license files were derived from
the GlobalPlatform project's file.  Many thanks go to Karsten Ohme, Snit Mo, and the
other GlobalPlatform library contributors for making such an excellent open source 
project available.


--------------------------
 Downloading & Compiling
--------------------------

Due to the simplistic and "beta" nature of the code, the author does not intend to distribute 
binaries at this time.  Compilation is fairly simple; however, using CMake.  Note that a fairly
modern compiler is required as certain C++ 11 features are used in the source code.

Required third party dependencies:
* GlobalPlatform (headers and libraries - be sure to compile against the latest "trunk" version)


Tested compilers:
* Visual Studio 2010
* Visual Studio 2013
* GCC 4.8 64-bit


--------------------------
 Program Use & Execution
--------------------------
Usage:  
  CAPtoIJC.exe <CAP file (input)> <IJC file (output)>

Example:
  CAPtoIJC.exe coolkeyapplet.cap coolkeyapplet.ijc
